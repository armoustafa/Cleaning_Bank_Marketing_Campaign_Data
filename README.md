## 📝 Description

This project focuses on:
- Cleaning and preprocessing raw data from a bank marketing campaign dataset.
- Splitting the dataset into smaller, more focused DataFrames for easier analysis.
- Reformatting and tidying data to ensure consistency and usability.

The project was completed as part of the **DataCamp Guided Project**: [Cleaning Bank Marketing Data in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/1613), which provides detailed steps for executing this process.

## 📂 Project Instructions

1. Subset, clean, and reformat the `bank_marketing.csv` dataset to create and store three new files:
   - **Client Data**: Stored in `client.csv`.
   - **Campaign Data**: Stored in `campaign.csv`.
   - **Economics Data**: Stored in `economics.csv`.

2. **Detailed Steps**:
   - Split and tidy `bank_marketing.csv` into three DataFrames: `client`, `campaign`, and `economics`.
   - Ensure each DataFrame contains the specified columns and is formatted with the appropriate data types.
   - Save the resulting DataFrames as `.csv` files (`client.csv`, `campaign.csv`, and `economics.csv`) **without an index**.
